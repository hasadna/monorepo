# How to clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/hasadna/hasadna.git
```

# How to start working on new task
Check your status
```
git status
```
If you see red files, then you need to put them somewhere. Stash might be good place.
```
git add -A
git stash
```
Open master
```
git checkout master
```
Pull fresh updates from github
```
git pull origin master
```
Create development branch
```
git checkout -b my-dev-branch
```
You can set your own name instead of `my-dev-branch`  

Great! You're ready to start. Now you can add your own changes to the code.

# How to create Pull Request
Add your changes to index
```
git add -A
```
Check which files were added to index.  
There should be only the files, which you modified,  
no node_modules, dist, and else autogenerated files.  
Index files are highlighted as green.
```
git status
```
Commit your changes
```
git commit -m "my awesome update"
```
Now you can review your own changes
```
git show
```
Send your code to github
```
git push origin my-dev-branch
```

Open page of your repository on github. You will see an offer to create Pull Request:

Now you can write nice title, ask someone to review, and add some description.  
It's last chance to check your code before creating PR :)
