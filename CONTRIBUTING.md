# How to start working on new task

Clone your repository
```
git clone https://github.com/hasadna/hasadna.git
```
You can use ssh if you'd like.  

Create development branch
```
git checkout -b my-dev-branch
```
You can set your own name instead of `my-dev-branch`  

Great! You're ready to start. Now you can add your own changes to the code.

# How to create Pull Request

Commit your changes
```
git add -A
git commit -m "my awesome update"
```

Send your code to github (**don't push to master**)
```
git push origin my-dev-branch
```

Open page of your repository on github. You will see an offer to create Pull Request:

Now you can write nice title, ask someone to review, and add some description.  
It's last chance to check your code before creating PR :)
