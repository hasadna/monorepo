# How to clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/hasadna/hasadna.git
```

# How to start working on new task
Check your status
```
git status
```
If you see red files, then you need to put them somewhere. Stash might be good place.
```
git add -A
git stash
```
Open master
```
git checkout master
```
Pull fresh updates from github
```
git pull origin master
```
Create development branch
```
git checkout -b my-dev-branch
```
You can set your own name instead of `my-dev-branch`  

Great! You're ready to start. Now you can add your own changes to the code.

# How to create Pull Request
Add your changes to index
```
git add -A
```
Check which files were added to index.  
There should be only the files, which you modified,  
no node_modules, dist, and else autogenerated files.  
Index files are highlighted as green.
```
git status
```
Commit your changes
```
git commit -m "my awesome update"
```
Now you can review your own changes
```
git show
```
Send your code to github
```
git push origin my-dev-branch
```

Open page of your repository on github. You will see an offer to create Pull Request:

Now you can write a nice title, ask someone to review, and add some description.
Make sure your PR title and description match what you actually did. If it is related to a specific project, mark the title as such with the format:

`ProjectName: PR title`

Also it's last chance to check your code before creating PR :)

When PR is created, don't forget to send a link to slack:

# How to merge PR
Once your PR is approved and all CI checks have passed, do the following to merge:
* Make sure the title and description reflect what changed and are up-to-date.
* Select the second option in merge options list and click "Squash and merge":

* Set the merge commit message as the PR title. Additionally you can leave a description, that summarizes the whole PR, or leave it empty. But please do not send commit list with the description, because it takes too much space on git.

# Opening an issue
If it is related to a specific project, mark the title as such, like this:

`ProjectName: Issue title`

# Adding a new project
When adding a new project:
* Add a README.md. Mention the following:
  * Project abstract
  * How to install / use / run
  * `ProjectName`, which is like the ID for the project, so issue and PR titles can be labelled using it.
* If you want a different license than the rest of the repo, add it to the project root.
