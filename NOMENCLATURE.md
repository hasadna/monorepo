# Our nomenclature
This is a guideline on how we name things, in addition to the per-language usual style guide.
These are in lowerCamelCase, but hold for other_styles as well.

* absFilename - absolute folder + filename
* relFilename - relative folder + filename
* filename - just filename
* absPath - absolute folder
* relPath - relative folder
