# Generation BUILD files automatically

### How it works
The tool generates automatically BUILD files in the whole project in folders that contains java or/and proto files. All files generated by the tool start with `# THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED` line. 
All BUILD files start with `# THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED` line will be regenerated in each launch the tool.

### Requirements to using the tool
- The package name should be the same that path to the file in the project
- Package import is prohibited. Instead of that, it's needed to use a single class import

### How to generate BUILD file
To generate BUILD files run `generate_build_files.sh` script.

### How to create a custom BUILD file
You can generate the BUILD file by the tool and remove `# THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED` line. After that the file won't be regenerated

### How to ignore some folder
If you don't want to create BUILD files for some folder add the path to the folder to `generate_build_files.sh` script in `build_file_generation_blacklist` flag.

### Actions after adding new third party dependency
After adding new third party dependency run the following command 

```tools/build_file_generator/third_party_deps/third_party_deps_updater.sh && bazel run //tools/build_file_generator/third_party_deps:third_party_deps_tool -- --build_file_path tools/build_file_generator/third_party_deps/BUILD``` 

It'll update `tools/build_file_generator/third_party_deps/BUILD` file and regenerate `third_party_deps.zip` file

### Actions after adding/updating new http_archive dependency
By default the tool supports `startup_os` http_archive dependency
After updating `startup_os` http_archive dependency run the following command:
```bazel run //tools/build_file_generator/http_archive_deps:http_archive_deps_tool```

After adding or updating new http_archive dependency run the following command: 
```bazel run //tools/build_file_generator/http_archive_deps:http_archive_deps_tool -- --http_archive_names <your_http_archive_name>```

It'll regenerate `http_archive_deps.prototxt` file
