# Avodata

Project label is `avodata`.

## Description

A research project for helping gather "soft attributes" for professions, to help people choose their next profession.
"Soft attributes" may be things like "stress level", "working with people",
"teamwork", "technological work" etc that are harder to quantify and therefore
compare, than, say, compensation, but are often more important when choosing
a profession.
The attributes are gathered using a relative measure between 2 professions.

More details are in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hAR_rdpddoRzNuevwINT-q7xLB4XPQ6GBjpFpTf-RbM/edit#heading=h.13nisaeye7as).
