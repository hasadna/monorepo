# Sample data analysis pipeline

This project simulates data analysis workflow with two steps:
* step1: take first names from file1.txt, last names from file2.txt and make a prototxt out of them
* step2: take prototxt from step1 (either from the task, or uploaded result file, or uploaded archive with file) and count number of users
