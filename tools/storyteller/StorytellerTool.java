/*
 * A way to tell the story of what you're up to.
 *
 * Storyteller is a team communication tool. Its purpose is to help you tell people what you're
 * working on, how you're working on it, the problems you encountered on the way that you bravely and
 * creatively solved, as well as funny, sad and amazing things that happened along the way.
 * You can do this by running it, taking screenshots (AKA "desktop selfies"), and later choosing
 * which to share.
 *
 * How Storyteller works:
 * - Storyteller is a small desktop app. It has 2 modes:
 *   - Time tracking and screenshot
 *   - Screenshot only
 * - All of storyteller's output files are stored in a folder, configurable using stories_path.
 * - You can review all output files (screenshots, stories, time tracking if enabled).
 * - When you're done, you run 'storyteller_tool share' to upload the files and share them. Stories are
 *   shared with your whole team. This way, everyone can know what you're up to, ask you questions,
 *   offer help, quench their curiosity, etc.
 *
 * - Note: If you work hourly, the time tracking part can be used to create invoice pdfs. Note that
 *     some countries may have additional requirements such as digital signatures, which we don't
 *     currently support.
 *
 * Configuration:
 * Edit and copy example_config.txt to ~/.storyteller
 *
 * Usage:
 * To build:
 * bazel build //tools/storyteller:storyteller_tool;
 * To list stories:
 * bazel-bin/tools/storyteller/storyteller_tool list
 * To share stories:
 * bazel-bin/tools/storyteller/storyteller_tool share
 * To run desktop app in screenshot-only mode:
 * bazel run //tools/storyteller:storyteller_screenshot_ui_tool
 * To run desktop app in time-and-screenshot mode:
 * bazel run //tools/storyteller:storyteller_time_and_screenshot_ui_tool
